I saw that a "uses page" was a [cool thing](https://uses.tech/) people were doing, so here's mine &mdash; a handy page of the things I use, just in case that's the sort of thing that tickles your fancy.

## Hardware

Under my desk is [a PC](https://imtom.notion.site/5037d6c38aec4d018d4e52e768d0d834) that's getting on a bit but still runs plenty fine. There's an i7 4790k and a GTX 970 inside, alongside 16GB of RAM. I have three monitors: two 23" 16:9 1080p affairs and a 17" 4:3 LG.
I type on a DASkeyboard Prime 13 (MX Browns) and click with an MX Master 3.

My daily laptop is a ThinkPad X280 with an i5 8350U. It has most of the bells and whistles.

An iPhone 12 mini lives in my pocket, along with the obligatory Airpods. On my wrist is a 4th gen Apple Watch. That's enough apples to [keep the doctor away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_apple_a_day_keeps_the_doctor_away) for months.

## Software

My computers run Windows 10 Pro because I'm lazy, though the ThinkPad has a Manjaro dualboot and I've played around with Hackintoshing.

I browse with Firefox on desktop and Safari on my phone. I type in VS Code and Notion. GitKraken is my Git GUI of choice and I use Powershell/Debian in the Windows Terminal.
