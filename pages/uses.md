I saw [others](https://uses.tech/) creating a page like this, so I thought I'd hop on the bandwagon and share the things I use.

***

## Hardware

Under my desk is [a PC](https://imtom.notion.site/5037d6c38aec4d018d4e52e768d0d834) that's getting on a bit but still runs plenty fine. I type on a DASkeyboard Prime 13 (MX Browns) and click with an MX Master 3.

My daily laptop is a ThinkPad X280 with an i5 8350U with most of the bells and whistles.

An iPhone 12 mini lives in my pocket, along with the obligatory Airpods. On my wrist is a 4th gen Apple Watch. That's enough apples to [keep the doctor away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_apple_a_day_keeps_the_doctor_away) for months.

## Software

My computers run Windows 10 Pro because I'm lazy, though the ThinkPad has a Manjaro dualboot and I've played around with Hackintoshing.

I browse with Firefox on desktop and Safari on my phone. For development, VS Code is where I type and GitKraken is my Git GUI of choice. I use Powershell/Debian in the Windows Terminal.

For productivity and organisation, Notion is exceptional. Have a look at the Wiki in the menu!
