This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) to show what I am currently focused on, both personally and professionally. 

# Currently I am...
- Studying and making sure I'm being as [organised](/uses) as possible.
- Exploring Docker and K8S. (See [my homelab](https://wiki.tomr.me/lab)!).
- Continuing to half-seriously learn Welsh.
- Investigating cycling trips to take in 2022.
