[SuperCutter](https://github.com/itsmeimtom/supercutter) is a tool to extract segments from downloaded YouTube videos based on their captions.

It was created after I noticed that [CGP Estate Agents](https://www.cgpooks.co.uk/) used phrases such as "a large size room" or "a good size" comically often during [their tours](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfcoX8GszBlY-NFidzD_h9A). After manually editing [a supercut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fi1-D0Ss3g) of some occurrences, I endeavored to (somewhat) automate the process.
