Realising I was subscribed to too many [subreddits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Subreddits) to keep a clean feed, I created a tool to find which communites were the least active and allow me to easilly unsubscribe from them.

[View the code on GitHub](https://github.com/itsmeimtom/redditunsubinactive) or [give the tool a try](https://github-pages.thomasr.me/redditunsubinactive/).
