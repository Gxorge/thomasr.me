Some of my friends&mdash;namely [Dan](https://dwilliams.uk/) and [Dav](https://davwheat.dev/)&mdash;are interested in mobile networking infrastructure and the testing of various cellular carriers. This webapp was built to allow speedtest from a CSV file exported from the [Speedtest.net app](https://www.speedtest.net/apps) to be viewed on a map.

The page was written in Javascript with Leaflet.js and you can use the site [here](https://github-pages.thomasr.me/speedtestdotnetcsvmap/).
